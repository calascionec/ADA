## Description

_This game has stayed true to its roots as a basic browser game.  You are greeted by the sound of alarms going off, an anxiety-inducing countdown timer, and an incredibly unhelpful computer telling you to eject!  Despite your best efforts, you crash land on the mysterious planet of U'tah.  Your computer companion informs you that you must venture to the outside world in order to retrieve three vital spaceship parts that are definitely not everyday household items and/or toys (cannot stress that enough).  Once outside, you find that your oxygen levels deplete slowly at rest, and quicker the "more you move" (a.k.a. moving the mouse).  Once you have found the requisite parts you can return to the ship, where you are greeted with your final test: to fix your computer's corrupted launch programming.  Congratulations, you've gotten off that desolate rock!_

P.S. George totally said it was cool if we used some footage from one of his films.  Bet you can't guess which one!
